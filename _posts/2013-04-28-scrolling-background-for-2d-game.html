Last month, I started researching LibGDX, a game engine mainly targeted for Android.
Also, this was the first time I worked with a game engine.
</p>

<p>
My goal is to develop a platform game like
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nekki.vector">Vector</a>
but much simpler. This is also inspired by
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imangi.templerun">Temple Run</a>.
The main character keeps running and avoid being chased by the NPC. Precisely, I
have to say that the main character just stays at one place and the background
keeps moving backward.
</p>

<p>
The first problem that I encounterd was the infinite scrolling background. I
have researched through Google with many solutions. However, all of them are too
complex to solve that simple task. The code can be up to 100 lines long with
tons of complicated mathematical formula to calculate how to scroll the
background. Finally, I gave up and decided to come up with my own solution.
Amazingly, it took me only less than 15 minutes and about 10 lines of code to
achieve it.
</p>

<p>
The theory is very simple. Assume that you have a background file names bg.jpg,
what you have to do now is to draw that background, move and loop it side by
side. Let's look at the image below and I'll explain
</p>

Actually, what we have to do it is just move the separator and draw 2 background
image on two sides of it. When the separator reach the screen edge, move it back
to the other screen edge and then continue all the previous steps.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at the video of this very simple example (sorry for the bad video
quality).
</p>

Here is the code which I implemented using
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/">LibGdx</a>. For other engine, it would be
similar, the same theory, just different implementation. The demo code below is
very dirty, so don't use it in the production.
</p>

</p>
First, declare a the background texture and the camera. The currentBgX is the
current X position on the co-ordinate of the separator. lastTimeBg is used for
determine the time between each time the background move.
</p>

{% highlight java %}
OrthographicCamera camera;
Texture background;
float currentBgX;
long lastTimeBg;
{% endhighlight %}

In the create() method, init those variable

{% highlight java %}
// Init the camera
camera = new OrthographicCamera();
camera.setToOrtho(false, 800, 480);

// Init the background image
background = new Texture(Gdx.files.internal("bg.jpg"));

// the separator first appear at the position 800 (the edge of the screen, see
// the camera above)
currentBgX = 800;

// set lastTimeBg to current time
lastTimeBg = TimeUtils.nanoTime();
{% endhighlight %}

In the render() function, draw the background on both sides of the sepearator
between the batch.begin() and batch.end() block

{% highlight java %}
batch.begin();
// draw the first background
batch.draw(background, currentBgX - 800, 0);
// draw the second background
batch.draw(background, currentBgX, 0);
batch.end();
{% endhighlight %}

Also, in the render() method, we need to move the separator

{% highlight java %}
// move the separator each 1s
if(TimeUtils.nanoTime() - lastTimeBg > 100000000){
	// move the separator 50px
	currentBgX -= 50;
	// set the current time to lastTimeBg
	lastTimeBg = TimeUtils.nanoTime();
}

// if the seprator reaches the screen edge, move it back to the first position
if(currentBgX == 0){
	currentBgX = 800;
}
{% endhighlight %}

You can download the source
<a href="/files/2013-04-11-parallax-scrolling-background-for-2d-game/repeatedbg.zip">
here</a>
After downloading, import those 4 projects into Eclipse. Depending on your
preference, you can run the project as an Android app, Desktop app or HTML5 app.
