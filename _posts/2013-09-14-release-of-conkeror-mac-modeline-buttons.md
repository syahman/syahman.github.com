Today, I have finished my first package for Conkeror: Conkeror Mac Modeline
Buttons. This is a really useful package for people who are new to Conkeror.

The source code is hosted on Github at
[https://github.com/tmtxt/conkeror-mac-modeline-buttons](https://github.com/tmtxt/conkeror-mac-modeline-buttons). The information as
well as the instruction on how to install and use is presented on the homepage
at [Conkeror Mac Modeline Buttons](/conkeror-mac-modeline-buttons.html).

This is the demo picture. Give it a try and comment me anything that I can
improve
