Today, we have finish our first game on LibGdx name Agent 069. Actually, all 3
members in our group are programmers, not designer so that we are not good at
designing and images so that game graphic is not very good. Also, when swpie up
the screen to control the main character to jump up, it's a bit laggy or slowly
react, we still don't know why.

The game is about X-rider (codename 069). He is a top undercover agent and CIA.
He has
James Bond’s charm, Bruce Lee’s martial arts mastery and Rambo’s gun skills. His
latest mission is to infiltrate a terrorist headquarter deep inside a Chinese
rural area. His main activity in this game is to escape from the terrorists
after assassinating the boss and having his cover blown and his only tool is his
trusty motorbike. 069 will go through 3 areas which are effectively the game’s 3
stages.
