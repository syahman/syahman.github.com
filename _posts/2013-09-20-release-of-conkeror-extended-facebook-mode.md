Another extension for Conkeror for browsing Facebook has been released today.
This is just the very first version so it has only two features but they are
really useful. It provides the ability to scroll through a long news feed page
and open the story that you want to read later with ease. Have a look at it
homepage, try it, bookmark this page and you'll be notified when there is a new
version release.
