# Introduction

I'm the person who is interested in terminal and command line interface. I love
controlling everything in my computer using my keyboard since it's the fastest
way to interact with my computer. It helps me concentrate on what I'm
working with on the screen and speed up my work because I don't have to move my
eyes out of the screen and move my hands out of the keyboard. Especially when I
work at night, I usually turn off the light and I can see nothing but my screen
and I don't want to waste my time looking for the mouse.

As a result, I really hate the default file manager on my Mac, Finder (or
Windows Explorer that I used to work with in the past), which decreases my speed
considerably. I have been constantly looking for a better solution until I found
Emacs. Like Conkeror (an Emacs based browser), I felt in love with it right at
the first time when I saw my relative demonstrate how Emacs can help me in
managing my files with ease. I can use the keyboard to control all the functions
of Emacs Dired mode.

After a long time getting used to and researching Emacs Dired mode, I have
collected some useful tips and developed some features to make Dired completely
replace my default file manager. This post is a collection of all those useful
tips as well as the functions that I developed. Also, the content in this
article assumes that you already have the basic knowledge about Emacs and Dired.

**Note**: Most of the tips as well as the functions presented in this series are
designed for MacOS and Ubuntu. However, you can apply them for many other
Unix-based OS. Unfortunately, if you are using Windows, you will have to change
to either Ubuntu or MacOS since Windows is never a good environment for Emacs
lovers.
