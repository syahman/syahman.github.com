# Introduction

Nowaday, with the development of technology, you probably own more then one
technological devices. You can have a Windows PC for playing games at home, a
MacOS computer for working purpose and a Windows Phone one for on-the-go
entertainment. One popular problem for people who have than one devices is
managing, organizing their files, especially music library (other types will be
discussed in other articles).

Luckily, if you are using Android devices along with your computer, there is a
solution from Google called Google Play Music. It helps you centralize your
music library on the cloud for easy management. It also provides the ability to
organize the music library by artist, album, playlist,... You can then listen to
your collection online from any computer with an Internet connection and ofline
on Android with the help of Google Play Music app.

# Google Music

Google Music is now available inside America only. In order to use it, you have
to either fake your IP to a US one (using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) for
example) or ask one of your friends who live in USA to
register it for you. Don't worry since you only have do this for the first time.
After that, ther will be no verification.

After you have fake your IP or ask one of your friend, simply access
[http://music.google.com](http://music.google.com) and login with your Google
account, follow the instruction and activate it for free.

# Uploading and Managing Music Library

Uploading music with Google Music is really simple. You don't have to choose
each file one by one. Instead, Google offers a desktop app called Music Manager.
After you have successfully activate Google Music, log in to Google Music at
[http://music.google.com](http://music.google.com) and then click `Upload Music`
button, download the Music Manager app and then install it into your computer.
It has the option to monitor your music folder and auto upload everytime you add
new music files into that folder so you don't have to worry whether this file
has been uploaded yet. Everything is automated.

After finish uploading music, you can open Google Music in your web browser and
edit song info as well as create playlist for online listening.

# Enjoying Music

Now you have finished uploaded your library, it's time to enjoy your music.
Everything you need is a computer with internet connection because you listen to
your music online. In case you migrate to a new computer, the desktop Music
Manager app allow you to download your entire collection for offline listening.

The most interesting part is to enjoy your music on Android devices. You will
need Google Play Music (can be installed from Google Play Store). The app helps
you listen to your library without having to open a web browser. It supports
streaming music online and even selecting with songs/album/playlist to keep on
the phone for offline playback.

Now let take your music experiment with Android to a higher level with
musiXmatch (install it from Google Play Store). Everytime you play a song in
Google Music Play app, musiXmatch will automatically search for the song lyric
on the internet and display it for you. You don't have to do anything, just play
the song and select the lyric on the notification bar and you're done. I have
tried and receive about 95% correct results. It's really accurate and support
many different languages, even Vietnamese, which I didn't think that it can
search.
