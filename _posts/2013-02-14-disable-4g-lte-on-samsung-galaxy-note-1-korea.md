I was given a Samsung Galaxy Note 1 - LTE Korea version. Sadly, in my country,
4G has not appeared yet. So I can only use 3G to access internet on the go.
However, since it's the LTE version, it constantly looks for 4G network, which
drains my battery so quickly. It's so annoying that I have to recharge the
battery every 6-7 hours.

All the tutorials on the internet that I found didn't help me. They all told me
to go to **Setting -> More -> Mobile Networks -> Pref** and select the prefered
network type. However, there is no option called pref or something like that
there.

After researching through the internet, I found that there is a Carrier Hidden
Menu inside the phone app and we can change many settings there. Still, I don't
know why they do not put these general preferences into Settings :-|

Here is how we activate that Hidden Menu. There are 3
versions of Korean Galaxy Note: E160 S/K/L.

* For S and K model: open up Phone app and type in 319712358, enter 774632 as
  the password
* For S model: open up Phone app and type in 319712358, enter 996412 as the
  password
* For L model: open up Phone app and type in 319712358, enter 0821 as the password
